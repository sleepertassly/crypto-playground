YOUR freedman and procurator,[1025] Maximus, behaved, Sir, during all
the time we were together, with great probity, attention, and diligence;
as one strongly attached to your interest, and strictly observant of
discipline. This testimony I willingly give him; and I give it with all
the fidelity I owe you.
