[1009] As I am sensible, Sir, that the highest applause my actions can
receive is to be distinguished by so excellent a prince, I beg you would
be graciously pleased to add either the office of augur or septemvir [1009]
(both which are now vacant) to the dignity I already enjoy by your
indulgence; that I may have the satisfaction of publicly offering up
those vows for your prosperity, from the duty of my office, which I
daily prefer to the gods in private, from the affection of my heart.
