HAVING been attacked last year by a very severe and dangerous illness, I
employed a physician, whose care and diligence, Sir, I cannot
sufficiently reward, but by your gracious assistance. I entreat you
therefore to make him a denizen of Rome; for as he is the freedman of a
foreign lady, he is, consequently, himself also a foreigner. His name is
Harpocras; his patroness (who has been dead a considerable time) was
Thermuthis, the daughter of Theon. I further entreat you to bestow the
full privileges of a Roman citizen upon Hedia and Antonia Harmeris, the
freedwomen of Antonia Maximilla, a lady of great merit. It is at her
desire I make this request.
