YOU act most generously in so early soliciting in favour of those whom
Valerius Paulinus has confided to your trust. I have accordingly granted
the freedom of the city to such of his freedmen for whom you requested
it, and have directed the patent to be registered: I am ready to confer
the same on the rest, whenever you shall desire me.
