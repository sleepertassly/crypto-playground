THE debts which we are owing to the public are, by the prudence, Sir, of
your counsels, and the care of my administration, either actually paid
in or now being collected: but I am afraid the money must lie
unemployed. For as on one side there are few or no opportunities of
purchasing land, so, on the other, one cannot meet with any person who
is willing to borrow of the public [1042b] (especially at 12 per cent,
interest) when they can raise money upon the same terms from private
sources. You will consider then, Sir, whether it may not be advisable,
in order to invite responsible persons to take this money, to lower the
interest; or if that scheme should not succeed, to place it in the hands
of the decurii, upon their giving sufficient security to the public. And
though they should not be willing to receive it, yet as the rate of
interest will be diminished, the hardship will be so much the less.
