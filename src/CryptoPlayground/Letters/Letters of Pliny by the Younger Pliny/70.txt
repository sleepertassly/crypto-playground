YOUR letter was particularly acceptable to me, as it mentioned your
desire that I would send you something of mine, addressed to you, to
insert in your works. I shall find a more appropriate occasion of
complying with your request than that which you propose, the subject you
point out to me being attended with some objections; and when you
reconsider it, you will think so.--As I did not imagine there were any
booksellers at Lugdunum,[137] I am so much the more pleased to learn
that my works are sold there. I rejoice to find they maintain the
character abroad which they raised at home, and I begin to flatter
myself they have some merit, since persons of such distant countries are
agreed in their opinion with regard to them. Farewell.
