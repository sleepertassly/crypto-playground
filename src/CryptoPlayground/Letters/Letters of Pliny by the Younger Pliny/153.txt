I HAVE been pressed by some persons to take upon myself the enquiry of
causes relating to claims of freedom by birth-right, agreeably to a
rescript of Domitian's to Minucius Rufus, and the practice of former
proconsuls. But upon casting my eye on the decree of the senate
concerning cases of this nature, I find it only mentions the proconsular
provinces.[1053] I have therefore, Sir, deferred interfering in this
affair, till I shall receive your instructions as to how you would have
me proceed.
