NYMPHIDIUS Lupus,[1027] Sir, and myself, served in the army together; he
commanded a body of the auxiliary forces at the same time that I was
military tribune; and it was from thence my affection for him began. A
long acquaintance has since mutually endeared and strengthened our
friendship. For this reason I did violence to his repose, and insisted
upon his attending me into Bithynia, as my assessor in council. He most
readily granted me this proof of his friendship; and without any regard
to the plea of age, or the ease of retirement, he shared, and continues
to share, with me, the fatigue of public business. I consider his
relations, therefore, as my own; in which number Nymphidius Lupus, his
son, claims my particular regard. He is a youth of great merit and
indefatigable application, and in every respect well worthy of so
excellent a father. The early proof he gave of his merit, when he
commanded a regiment of foot, shows him to be equal to any honour you
may think proper to confer upon him; and it gained him the strongest
testimony of approbation from those most illustrious personages, Julius
Ferox and Fuscus Salinator. And I will add, Sir, that I shall rejoice in
any accession of dignity which he shall receive as an occasion of
particular satisfaction to myself.
