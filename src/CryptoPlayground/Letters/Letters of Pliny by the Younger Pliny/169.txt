THE free and confederate city of the Amiseni[1063] enjoys, by your
indulgence, the privilege of its own laws. A memorial being presented to
me there, concerning a charitable institution,[1064] I have subjoined it
to this letter, that you may consider, Sir, whether, and how far, this
society ought to be licensed or prohibited.
