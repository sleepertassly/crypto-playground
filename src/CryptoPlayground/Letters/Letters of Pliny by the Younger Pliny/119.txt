WHILE I was making a progress in a different part of the province, a
most extensive fire broke out at Nicomedia, which not only consumed
several private houses, but also two public buildings; the town-house
and the temple of Isis, though they stood on contrary sides of the
street. The occasion of its spreading thus far was partly owing to the
violence of the wind, and partly to the indolence of the people, who,
manifestly, stood idle and motionless spectators of this terrible
calamity. The truth is the city was not furnished with either engines,
[1033]buckets, or any single instrument suitable for extinguishing
fires; which I have now however given directions to have prepared. You
will consider, Sir, whether it may not be advisable to institute a
company of fire-men, consisting only of one hundred and fifty members. I
will take care none but those of that business shall be admitted into
it, and that the privileges granted them shall not be applied to any
other purpose. As this corporate body will be restricted to so small a
number of members, it will be easy to keep them under proper regulation.
