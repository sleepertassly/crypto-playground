THOUGH by my edicts I have ordained that no largesses shall be given out
of the public money, yet, that numberless private persons may not be
disturbed in the secure possession of their fortunes, those donations
which have been made long since ought not to be called in question or
revoked. We will not therefore enquire into anything that has been
transacted in this affair so long ago as twenty years; for I would be no
less attentive to secure the repose of every private man than to
preserve the treasure of every public community.
