I WAS greatly obliged, Sir, in my late illness, to Posthumius Marinus,
my physician; and I cannot make him a suitable return, but by the
assistance of your wonted gracious indulgence. I entreat you then to
make Chrysippus Mithridates and his wife Stratonica (who are related to
Marinus) denizens of Rome. I entreat likewise the same privilege in
favour of Epigonus and Mithridates, the two sons of Chrysippus; but with
this restriction [1005] that they may remain under the dominion of their
father, and yet reserve their right of patronage over their own
freedmen. I further entreat you to grant the full privileges of a Roman
to L. Satrius Abascantius, P. Caesius Phosphorus, and Pancharia Soteris.
This request I make with the consent of their patrons.[1005]
