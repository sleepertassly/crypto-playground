CARE must be taken to supply the city of Nicomedia with water; and that
business, I am well persuaded, you will perform with all the diligence
you ought. But really it is no less incumbent upon you to examine by
whose misconduct it has happened that such large sums have been thrown
away upon this, lest they apply the money to private purposes, and the
aqueduct in question, like the preceding, should be begun, and
afterwards left unfinished. You will let me know the result of your
inquiry.
